# Description

Simple software ray-marching renderer that prints a render into the console in an ASCII-character style. This is my first program that can render a 3D scene. I made it for fun and to learn ray marching. Created in November 2023.

# Usage

1. Compile the code
2. Lower the text size in the terminal (so that the result fits on the screen)
3. Run it

- Additionally, you can edit macro values to change some parameters (like resolution, fov, etc.).
- The line `struct bodyData bodies[] = { ... }` is a list of bodies and their properties, feel free to edit it.
- Only works for windows, because  it uses `windows.h` to color the text.
